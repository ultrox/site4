**TLDR:**

```vim
cmap wq :echo "USE ZZ" <CR>
```

Even though this is `vim` related, this is teachable moment for the rest of us
looking for changing our behaviour. 

> When you remove the choice, or make it stupid hard/easy, one will predictably do more continent action. 

I really like using `ZZ` to save and close vim, but I'm so used to using `:wq`
and `:q!`. Its super hard to force myself to change this habit, as I don't even think about it, hence the habit. 

To alleviate this, and remove the choice I made it hard to use, actually
impossible, after couple of times trying to close the file with `:wq` I quickly
learned new keyboard shortcut, much more elegant `ZZ` to close & save the file.

This is how it looks like. 

```vim
" Force uzing ZZ and ZQ
cmap wq :echo "USE ZZ" <CR>
```

### Motivation behind it?

I usually do this action with my left hand(shift included), which force me to  
use my left pinky a lot, my left pinky, mind you is very clumsy so I very often
make typo in very critical moment, super irritating.

I fixed it now, hope you all like it.
